        <br> We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.

        <br> However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing or other uses.
        <br>
        <br>

        <span class="ptext-small-bold">THIRD PARTY LINKS</span>
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>

        <span class="ptext-small-bold">GOOGLE</span>
        <br>
        <br> Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users.
        <br>
        <br> We reserve the right to use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.
        <br>
        <br> Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and other sites on the Internet.

        <li>DoubleClick Platform Integration</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="ptext-small">
        We along with third-party vendors, such as Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding user interactions with ad impressions, and other ad service functions as they relate to our website.

        <br>
        <br>

        <span class="ptext-small-bold">CALIFORNIA ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT</span>
        <br>
        <br> CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
        <br>
        <br> According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:
        <br>
      </p>

      <ul class="ul-disc ptext-small">
        <li>Users can visit our site anonymously</li>
        <li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.</li>
        <li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</li>
        <li>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page</li>
        <li>Users are able to change their personal information by logging in to their account</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="ptext-small">
        <span class="ptext-small-bold">DO NOT TRACK REQUESTS</span>
        <br>
        <br> We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
        <br>
        <br>

        <span class="ptext-small-bold">Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</span>
        <br>
        <br> It's also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking
        <br>
        <br>

        <span class="ptext-small-bold">COPPA (CHILDREN ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT)</span>
        <br>
        <br> When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
        <br>
        <br> We do not specifically market to children under 13.
        <br>
        <br>

        <span class="ptext-small-bold">FAIR INFORMATION PRACTICES</span>
        <br>
        <br> In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
        <br>
        <br> We will notify the users via email within 7 business days
        <br>
        <br> We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
        <br>
        <br>

        <span class="ptext-small-bold">CAN SPAM ACT</span>
        <br>
        <br> The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
        <br>
        <br> We collect your email address in order to:
        <br>

        <li>We may also send you additional information related to your product and/or service.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="ptext-small">
        To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following:
        <br>

      <ul class="ul-disc ptext-small">
        <li>NOT use false, or misleading subjects or email addresses</li>
